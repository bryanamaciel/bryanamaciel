<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Bryana Maciel</h1>
<h3 align="center">I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, where I developed a deep understanding of human behavior, cognitive processes, and emotional intelligence. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by studying Business Intelligence Analytics, which enables me to analyze and interpret data to derive actionable insights. This interdisciplinary background equips me to bridge the gap between human behavior and data-driven decision-making, making me adept at understanding user needs while leveraging analytical tools to enhance business strategies. My goal is to apply this unique skill set in roles that combine psychological insights with data analytics to drive impactful organizational outcomes.</h3>
